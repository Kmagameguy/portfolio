  - name: 'Chernobyl Cinematic'
    description: >-
      This was an environment I created for a final assignment.
      The goal was to create a cinematic based on some storyboards we had created earlier.
      This scene represents an abandoned place in Chernobyl, which may be haunted by something
      otherworldly.

  - name: '360 Flip'
    description: >-
      This animation was done as a love letter to growing up skateboarding.
      The fisheye effect was captured by reflecting the entire scene against a spherical
      object pressed right up against the virtual camera lens.

  - name: 'Droid Boot Animation'
    description: >-
      This was one of my first Moto Droid 1 "hacks".  After learning how to root my phone
      I was compelled to replace as much of the default interface &amp; animations as possible.
      This was one asset I created which replaced the start-up boot animation.

  - name: 'Future Junk Ship Turntable'
    description: >-
      For this assignment we were tasked with creating a space ship.
      I liked the idea of a pieced-together ship, so I made the main hull out
      of converted cruise-liner.  The escape pods are converted Volkswagen Buses.

      Another assignment piece.  We were provided with a few source images as concepts and
      had to recreate them in 3D.
