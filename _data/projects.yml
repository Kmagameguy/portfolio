    Just a simple, static website to host my stuff on the internet.
    I've been maintaining/re-inventing it since 2017.

    This project is always evolving. The latest change was migrating away
    from the github-pages gem-based deployment to a native jekyll build
    in GitHub Actions. I've also written some ruby-based helper scripts
    to make blog post management a bit less manual.

- title: Ocarina of Time Collectibles Tracker
  status_short: active
  project_type: static website
  started_at: February 2026
  link: https://kmagameguy.github.io/oot-collectibles
  image_preview: /assets/images/code/oot_heart_piece_tracker.png
  overview: >
    A simple static site to help make Heart Piece collection in
    The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time a bit more organized. While
    playing through the game recently I was having a hard time keeping
    track of the Heart Piece collectibles. I wanted some kind of
    tracking system to make it easier to see which Heart Pieces I'd
    already collected, and a grouping of them by region (to optimize a
    collection run). I created this simple static site with those goals in mind.
  features:
    - Session-based collection tracking
    - All 36 collectible Heart Pieces cataloged
    - Filters to narrow down Heart Pieces by region, age, and time of day required to collect them

    Most of my (current) programming is done in Ruby or Ruby on Rails,
    so this project seemed like a good opportunity to get acquainted with
    TypeScript, Vite, and React. Those technologies are definitely overkill
    for this but since I knew what the "vanilla" HTML/CSS/JS code could look
    like it made it a bit easier to approach/translate those concepts into
    this specific tech stack. The project uses the localStorage browser API
    as a bonus so you can leave and come back to the site between sessions and
    it will remember where you left off with your collection.

- title: Restiby
  status_short: active
  project_type: CLI
  started_at: July 2025
  link: https://github.com/kmagameguy/restiby
  overview: >
    I manage a self-hosted combination NAS/media server. As part of my maintenance
    routine I take snapshots of the data with [Restic](https://github.com/restic/restic).
    Restic is great, but I find it's interface a bit kludgy. To automate the backup
    process I wrote a small ruby utility, Restic (Ruby + Restic). The script is heavily
    influenced by [autorestic](https://github.com/cupcakearmy/autorestic) and some other
    folks' restic scripts from around the web. The project is still a work in progress but it's
    in good enough shape for me to use daily. There is preliminary support for restoring snapshots, but
    only for the latest snapshot of a backend.
  features:
    - Easy configuration with a YAML file(s)
    - "Simple installation: Just run bin/install"
    - Built-in Restic auto-updates
    - Automatic backend initialization
    - Automatic integrity checking post-backup
    - Automatic snapshot rotation/cleanup via "forget" policies
    - Support for post-run diffs delivered as notifications to Healthchecks.io or Discord

    I wanted this project to be super lightweight, so aside from the dependency
    on restic itself the only thing you'll need to use this utility is the
    core Ruby library.  The idea is to use really simple CLI commands to perform
    all the complex restic operations (e.g. restiby --action backup runs a backup snapshot
    for all your ocnfigured sources/destinations).
  code_example: |
    # Symlink the restiby script to /usr/local/bin/
    bin/install

    # Run integrity check against the configured backends
    restiby --action check

    # Create a new restic snapshot for every configured source/backend
    restiby --action backup

- title: Subscriptions Tracker
  status_short: active
  project_type: Web Application
  started_at: October 2024
  link: https://github.com/kmagameguy/subscriptions
  image_preview: /assets/images/code/subscriptions_tracker_preview.png
  overview: >
    Frustrated by yet another streaming service cost increase I realized I
    wanted an easy way to track subscription pricing changes over time.
    Partially for morbid curiosity, but also in hopes to get a better sense
    for the worst offenders so I could either search for an alternative
    or drop them entirely. Those goals resulted in this simple
    subscription tracker.
  features:
    - Individual user accounts
    - Track your subscriptions in the currency of your choice
    - Supports monthly, quarterly, semi-annually (twice a year), annually, and biennially (every two years) recurring subscriptions
    - Track price change history; Each edit to an existing subscription is cataloged so you can see the % increase since you first signed up

  tech_stack_comments: >
    Most of the Rails work I do in my day job is on smoewhat legacy systems
    so for this project I really wanted to try a fresher version of the Rails
    stack.  It started with Rails 7 and the (at the time) new Hotwire framework.
    For some reason I chose PostgreSQL for the database, mainly just to check it
    out, though the project doesn't really take advantage of any of its unique
    selling points.  You should be able to deploy it on bare metal or with Docker.

  overview: >
    A ruby gem designed around the <a href="https://www.igdb.com">IGDB API</a>.
    It helps facilitate data retrieval from teh API by abstracting some
    of the more complex query parameters the API expects.

    This was the (first?) ruby gem I've built outside of my day job.
    While working on a project related to game-tracking I decided
    to spin this code off as a compartmentalized gem.
  code_example: |
    client = IdgbClient::Api.new
    games = client.get(:games,
      search: "Burger Time",
      fields: "name,game_type.type,platforms.name")

    games.find { |game| game&.game_type&.type == "Main Game" }

    =>
    #<OpenStruct id=4609,
      name="Burger Time",
      platforms:
        [#<OpenStruct id=68, name="ColecoVision">,
        #<OpenStruct id=52,  name="Arcade">,
        #<OpenStruct id=125, name="PC-8800 Series">,
        #<OpenStruct id=77,  name="Sharp X1">,
        #<OpenStruct id=67,  name="Intellivision">,
        #<OpenStruct id=13,  name="DOS">,
        #<OpenStruct id=75,  name="Apple II">,
        #<OpenStruct id=374, name="Sharp MZ-2200">,
        #<OpenStruct id=129, name="Texas Instruments TI-99">,
        #<OpenStruct id=27,  name="MSX">],
      game_type=#<OpenStruct id=0, type="Main Game">>
