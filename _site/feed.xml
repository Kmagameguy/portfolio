&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;I was talking with one of my good friends the other day about the extinction of the traditional, classic, survival horror genre. &amp;nbsp;I realize that's a pretty inflammatory statement to make, but he and I grew up on the Resident Evil series (pre-Resident Evil 4, that is). &amp;nbsp;One of the hallmarks that we both really liked about the series was it's use of static cameras throughout environments - you just don't see that anymore. &amp;nbsp;It's either FPS or over-the-shoulder &quot;jump-out-at-you-boogeyman&quot; scares nowadays. &amp;nbsp;I'd imagine the developers originally had to use the static camera angle because of limited rendering power (from what I remember, most of the backgrounds were either matte skyboxes or pre-rendered camera projections). &amp;nbsp;Without that restriction, it makes sense that they'd move on to fully immersive, real-time rendered worlds. &amp;nbsp;My friend and I both agreed that in doing so, the genre (especially with 4) lost some of the tension due to the fact that you were always in control of what you could see. &amp;nbsp;Previously, it was always a gut-busting move to turn a corner when you didn't know what lurked behind it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Because I've been (not) hard at work trying to come up with my own survival horror game/mini-game, I wanted to give that classic static-camera style a try. &amp;nbsp;Here's what I ended up with:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table align=&quot;center&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;tr-caption-container&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.cubeupload.com/hTNTE8.gif&quot;

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Ignoring the choice of player character, I was pretty happy with the result (and also how efficiently the kismet code worked. &amp;nbsp;I don't know if I'll elaborate any further on this, but considering how incredibly easy this was to implement, I'm tempted to keep experimenting (eagle-eyed viewers will probably remember this particular hallway as an homage to the RE1 upstairs hallway, joining the Yawn room w/the first mask puzzle)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table align=&quot;center&quot;

scares nowadays. &amp;nbsp;I'd imagine the developers originally had to use the static camera angle because of limited rendering power (from what I remember, most of the backgrounds were either matte skyboxes or pre-rendered camera projections). &amp;nbsp;Without that restriction, it makes sense that they'd move on to fully immersive, real-time rendered worlds. &amp;nbsp;My friend and I both agreed that in doing so, the genre (especially with 4) lost some of the tension due to the fact that you were always in control of what you could see. &amp;nbsp;Previously, it was always a gut-busting move to turn a corner when you didn't know what lurked behind it.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Because I've been (not) hard at work trying to come up with my own survival horror game/mini-game, I wanted to give that classic static-camera style a try. &amp;nbsp;Here's what I ended up with:Penguins are so next-gen horror, didn't you know?&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Ignoring the choice of player character, I was pretty happy with the result (and also how efficiently the kismet code worked. &amp;nbsp;I don't know if I'll elaborate any further on this, but considering how incredibly easy this was to implement, I'm tempted to keep experimenting (eagle-eyed viewers will probably remember this particular hallway as an homage to the RE1 upstairs hallway, joining the Yawn room w/the first mask puzzle)Seriously, I probably sunk 2,000 hours into this game alone.Here's the setup:3 Cameras (in red), 3 triggersKismet: 3 Triggers, 2 Switches, 3 Cameras&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Of course, right before a huuuuuge flare-up in my work schedule I'm feeling more zoned in than ever before. I've started planning out a new survival/thriller game that I am hopefully going to follow through on. &amp;nbsp;Even though Peril On Monster Island 2 1/3 was a serious bomb, I learned how to (and not to do) a TON when creating a game. &amp;nbsp;I think this new project will be better suited to the UDK than POMI was since it uses a lot of the same mechanics as the average FPS.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Without going into the details of the project, one of the most immediate assets I need developed is a portable candle light, along with the hand that holds it. &amp;nbsp;I started working on the candle asset today. &amp;nbsp;Here is a rough of the low poly w/normal mapping applied:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table align=&quot;center&quot;

when the more powerful sources run out of fuel. &amp;nbsp;For the more advanced light sources (I'm thinking kerosene/oil lamps here), there'll be a toggle that will allow the player to feed more fuel into the burner for increased light radius/intensity, but at the cost of fuel. &amp;nbsp;I have no idea if that's realistic or not, but it seems pseudo-science-y enough for me. &amp;nbsp;This was the sandbox I crafted:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;table align=&quot;center&quot;

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Of course, right before a huuuuuge flare-up in my work schedule I'm feeling more zoned in than ever before. I've started planning out a new survival/thriller game that I am hopefully going to follow through on. &amp;nbsp;Even though Peril On Monster Island 2 1/3 was a serious bomb, I learned how to (and not to do) a TON when creating a game. &amp;nbsp;I think this new project will be better suited to the UDK than POMI was since it uses a lot of the same mechanics as the average FPS.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Without going into the details of the project, one of the most immediate assets I need developed is a portable candle light, along with the hand that holds it. &amp;nbsp;I started working on the candle asset today. &amp;nbsp;Here is a rough of the low poly w/normal mapping applied:Averaging ~1k polys. &amp;nbsp;A bit denser than I'd like but it should be fine.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Once I had the geometry sorted out (though it's still under revisions), I crafted up a fairly basic diffuse map that let me rough out a spec/detail normal map (At this point I just wanted to get a prototype in-engine and worry about the fussy details later).Normal, Specular, Diffuse, and Ambient Oclusion&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;One of the perks of my job as a teacher of game design is the flexibility I have with my classes. &amp;nbsp;Of course, there's always a curriculum to use as a guideline, but because I'm not bound by the restrictions of the US standardized k-12 program I can tailor each class to each group of kids. &amp;nbsp;Some are faster than others, so this ability makes things much more enjoyable for everyone involved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;We offer many courses, but the one in particular that I'm always excited to teach is FPS Level Design. &amp;nbsp;In this class, the students use the Unreal Development Kit to craft their own levels using the prefabs that come with the engine. &amp;nbsp;Most of them create deathmatch/free-for-all style maps, while a few of the more advanced students end up digging into capture the flag and other objective type maps. &amp;nbsp;Unfortunately, the courses only last an hour, for one day a week, for a duration of 6 weeks (a grand total of 6 hours of development time). &amp;nbsp;While this is enough time for a cursory introduction to the software, I've always wanted to start diving into Kismet code and showing them how to enhance the playability of their maps, but have never had the time to do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Last month I struck gold. &amp;nbsp;I was finishing up the last session of an FPS Level Design course when the parents asked if there was any way they could continue into a second session. &amp;nbsp;After almost no resistance from my boss (I could see the money signs cha-chinging in his eyes), we set up a tentative schedule and I got right to work developing an FPS Level Design Part II curriculum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;One of the problems we've always had with the FPS curriculum is the violence factor. &amp;nbsp;Our target age range is anywhere from 10 year olds and up, so violence and gore is always a concern with the parents - let alone the school systems we work with. &amp;nbsp;We're still having a tough time marketing it to schools, but with a little bit of time spent gutting the more violent aspects of the UDK engine out (eg blood, gore, gibbing, weapons, etc) we've started to see more signups for the FPS curriculum. &amp;nbsp;I actually like the more kid-friendly version of the UDK - with the weapons and violence stripped away I've noticed students focus harder on their level and its design rather than getting distracted with stuff that goes boom. &amp;nbsp;To kick start the premiere of the Part II curriculum, I went to work trying to think of ways to retrofit the UDK to be more &quot;G-Rated&quot; and decided on creating a new water gun model for use as the primary weapon. &amp;nbsp;Here's the progress below:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both;
