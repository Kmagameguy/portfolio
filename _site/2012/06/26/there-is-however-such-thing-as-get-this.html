<meta name="description" content="     As the title suggests, the game is NOW LIVE!  Well, it’s kinda been live for a while now.  Since June 13.  My bad.  Check it out over at http://www.kmagameguy.com/POMI.html! (maybe donate a dollar? maybe? no? anyone? Bueller? Bueller?)  Mostly, I just want people to play it and let me know what they think.  Liked it? Great!  Hated it!  Also cool I guess!  Most of all I’m just super excited to have actually finished a project for once, as well as finished it to a level of polish that I’m proud to stand against.  Of course, there’s tons of things I wanted to change or implement, but I think it’s ok for me to call it done for now.  Mainly because I don’t have much time to do anything anymore!  Spoiler alert ahead!     Literally the night after graduation (magna cum laude with highest achievement award [not to toot my own horn or anything!]), I was INUNDATED (sarcasm-ish) with employment opportunities.  One was for a teaching position near my hometown, while the other was for an Xbox project for a company in the DC area.  With some measure of trepidation (I’ve always liked the idea of teaching, especially to child prodigies), I took the Xbox project gig!  I started this past monday, so I’ve already served a week of time there!  Boy howdy does time fly!  While I’m not exactly sure what details I can and cannot discuss (NDAs being what they are and all), I CAN say with certainty that I am extremely fortunate and grateful to be where I am.  The perks are wonderful, and my co-workers are just as excellent.  It’s nice to be a part of a seriously well-put-together team.  The company is just a startup, so there’s not much media I can float around, though if you google “Fiteeza” you might be able to find some information on your own!" />
