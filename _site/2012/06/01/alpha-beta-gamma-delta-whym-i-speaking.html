<meta name="description" content="Sample Endgame &lt;div&gt;     In case you didn’t guess by the title and the previous screenshot, the game is finished.  Well, “finished” is probably a pretty liberal way of putting it.  To be clear - the gameplay is finished, and my first, full beta build is ready for distribution to my testers.  Even though it’s lacking a LOT of general polish, it’s pretty gratifying to finally see the light at the end of the tunnel.  The laundry list of to-do’s is as long as ever:&lt;/div&gt; - Fix Penny’s untextured hands (YellowMat won’t apply?) - Fix lightmass seams - Polish Menu Screen - Correct Penny’s first dialogue speed - Animate TV Feed - Red Herring objects - Crypt toys and princess-y stuff And those are just the immediate needs, (not including any known/yet-undiscovered bugs/broken functions!) I’m not sure where to go from here. I would like to add in an extra cinematic in the form of a secret ending for those adventurous players who go the extra mile in-game to complete a separate line of challenges. Though, the most nagging issue is that the game is still completely devoid of sound and music. I guess that would be the most sensible place to start working on now. I’ve got a little less than a week to meet my deadline, here’s to overconfidence and over-the-top ambition!" />
