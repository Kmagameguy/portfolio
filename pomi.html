		<h4>Indie game developed by myself over the course of 6 months during my time as an undergrad.</h4>
		<h4>Unreal Development Kit, 3ds Max, Photoshop, Modo, Speedtree utilized.</h4>

				<div class="pageHeading">Riverboat</div>
				<h4>Detail shot of the Riverboat Environment. This is the where the player begins the game, and must create a signal fire in hopes of rescue.</h4>

				<img src="gallery/pomi/riverboatI.jpg" alt="" /><br></br>
				<div class="pageHeading">Quest Breakdown - Signal Fire</div>
				<h4>To complete the quest, the player has to find 4-5 wood planks to deploy as kindling for a signal fire.  Doing so initiates a cutscene.</h4>
				<h4>Each trigger adds to the quest record, and checks if the player has all the wood.  If they do, then they are prompted accordingly.</h4>
				<h4>If they still have collecting to do, the event and wood mesh are removed from the game to prevent the player from picking it up again.</h4>
				<h4>Finally, once they've completed the quest they are rewarded with a cutscene that allows them further access to the island.</h4>

				<h4>Quick view of the Lodge environment.  This is where the brunt of the game's story is delivered.</h4>

				<div class="pageHeading">Level Management Breakdown - Transitions</div><br></br>
				<h4>One of the earliest problems I had with the UDK was figuring out a decent way to preserve game data between level transitions.</h4>
				<h4>I opted to use level streaming, as I didn't have the time or knowhow to code a kismet method to serialize the game data for read/write access.</h4>
				<h4>It turned out to work pretty well, so below I've included my method for transitioning the player between environments.</h4>
				<h4>Because level streaming largely depends on the hardware being used to run the game, I gave it a little flair by fading the screen to black,</h4>
				<h4>then overlaying a scaleform indeterminate loading screen to hide the geometry swapping and player teleportation.</h4>

				<div class="pageHeading">Wilderness</div>
				<h4>As a bonus to the curious players, tiki tokens are hidden throughout each environment.  If they're all collected, the player is rewarded</h4>
				<h4>with an extended "good" ending, vs. the standard "bad" ending if the tiki's are not all collected.</h4>
				<img src="gallery/pomi/wilderness.jpg" alt="" /><br></br>
				<div class="pageHeading">Regeneration Quest Breakdown - Cinematic</div>
				<h4>I didn't want to overburden the player with text or tedious, pixel-hunt-y game mechanics, so I opted to use cinematics in these places.</h4>
				<h4>I was fortunate that the Matinee feature in Kismet was so powerful - I was able to layer a lot of things like camera motion, particle FX,</h4>
				<h4>shader triggers, sounds, events, etc, with ease.  The regeneration cinematic was fun because it required a bunch of events to fire off just</h4>
				<h4>in the right sequence.  I also wanted modularity to the quests - this one in particular was one that could either be completed last, or first.</h4>

				<div class="pageHeading">Crypt</div>
				<h4>The crypt deviated from the rest of the design a bit by introducing the potential for the player to fail.</h4>
				<img src="gallery/pomi/crypt.jpg" alt="" /><br></br>
				<div class="pageHeading">Crypt Quest Breakdown - The Trap</div>
				<h4>From the beginning I struggled with the idea of having fatal traps in the game.  There were certain technical issues behind it,</h4>
				<h4>the biggest being the aforementioned inability to serialize game data out to a file.  Without this ability, killing a player would</h4>
				<h4>mean they'd have to start the game over from the beginning - which would be a huge deterrent for them to continue playing.</h4>
				<h4>I decided on a compromise in the form of a chamber that locks the player inside, and if they don't solve the puzzle within the time-limit</h4>
				<h4>the chamber resets and they have to start over.  It turned out to be not as punishing as starting from scratch, but still difficult enough</h4>
				<h4>to present a challenge.  To escape, the player has to rotate 4 pedestals so that they are facing the proper direction.  Each pedestal</h4>
				<h4>influences a different pedestal, which upped the ante in terms of difficulty.  To add to the tensions, the chamber fills with a fog</h4>
				<h4>volume, making everything more difficult to maneuver/see through.  As a tip that they were about to run out of time, the screen</h4>
				<h4>flashes red in growing intensity during the last few seconds of the countdown to simulate that the player can't get any oxygen.</h4>
