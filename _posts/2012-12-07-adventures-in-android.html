&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Long time no update! &nbsp;Since I last posted, I've moved on from Fiteeza and begun working at an afterschool program that teaches video game design to elementary school aged kids. &nbsp;It was daunting at first - managing a class of 12 kids by myself was scary business - but now it's thoroughly enjoyable to see these guys let their imaginations run wild and make games.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In the meantime, I've also been doing some freelance work - a graphic design gig here and there, though recently I landed myself a position creating an FPS Level for a yet unannounced PC/iOS game. &nbsp;I wish I could post updates here, but it is under heavy NDA in it's current stage and I have no interest in breaking that commitment! &nbsp;With both of those events conspiring together (plus the purchase of my first car!), I haven't had anything of value to talk about. &nbsp;Just about the only thing I created "for fun" was this promo poster for Resident Evil: Retribution that I put together the day before we went to see it. &nbsp;I honestly don't remember too much about the making of this poster (eg why I decided to format it in Spanish vs English - I think it was because "VENGAZA" sounded way more awesome than "RETRIBUTION"). &nbsp;I just remember being really stressed out and needing an outlet:<br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-c_4PYQ5Ve7I/UMK-iwVlzTI/AAAAAAAABf0/tH13NZJRnQc/s1600/Poster.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-c_4PYQ5Ve7I/UMK-iwVlzTI/AAAAAAAABf0/tH13NZJRnQc/s320/Poster.png" width="213" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now that the waters have settled a bit, I've found myself toying around with Android quite a bit. &nbsp;I have a Galaxy Nexus, and thanks to this guy here it's found a working Jellybean 4.2 build:</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1762846" target="_blank">MMuzzy's 4.2.1 JOP40D AOSP ROM</a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You might not know it from previous posts, but I really, REALLY like the Android ecosystem, and I've always been interested in developing for it. &nbsp;As of right now, I've put together a few standard mods for that particular ROM (all of which are included in that link). &nbsp;What I'm really looking forward to doing is customizing the interface. &nbsp;Having just finished the Fiteeza gig in which I was doing interface/user experience design, modifying the Android interface has sort of filled that void.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Here's my current setup:</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-155-IZn7E5w/UMLAF-6v3II/AAAAAAAABf8/1m5OlYVLpp4/s1600/android.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="284" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-155-IZn7E5w/UMLAF-6v3II/AAAAAAAABf8/1m5OlYVLpp4/s320/android.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The lockscreen is currently unmodified - and my next target! &nbsp;The homescreen has a few small tweaks applied that I think really make a difference. &nbsp;I removed the hotseat divider and app drawer icon - replacing the latter for a small triangle graphic. &nbsp;Next I shrunk the hotseat icons by about 20% - I really don't like the default Launcher look, everything is so big and flashy. &nbsp;I tend to like things to look a little more minimal and less distracting (especially once I start designing wallpapers!). &nbsp;The navbuttons were also replaced with new graphics that are a little less distracting, and I swapped the new JB style Google Search bar for the ICS style one. &nbsp;I'm not sure if I like the search bar though - I may remove the white frame entirely, leaving just the "GOOGLE" and voice search buttons active.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Overall I've had a great time playing with small edits like this. &nbsp;I owe a lot to the XDA and Rootzwiki communities for being so open to teaching newcomers like me how to make changes and edits. &nbsp;I'm really bad at reading the decompiled smali/baksmali code, but now that I'm starting to get the hang of the interface XMLs I can't wait to see what will be possible down the road.</div><br />
