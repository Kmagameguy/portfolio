<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After a short hiatus between quarters I'm back at it. &nbsp;This time around putting together all the business-y stuff I need to get the heck out of school. &nbsp;One of the first things I'm sending to get printed off is my business cards, snazzy!<br /><div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-W4nFW7EPnRQ/T4hVeVuqwaI/AAAAAAAABZU/w6AnV2FkD6U/s1600/BusinessCardBack.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-W4nFW7EPnRQ/T4hVeVuqwaI/AAAAAAAABZU/w6AnV2FkD6U/s320/BusinessCardBack.jpg" width="193" /></a><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-pZp16jb_Sww/T4hVf67kgDI/AAAAAAAABZc/9N2H38fzrgA/s1600/BusinessCardFront.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-pZp16jb_Sww/T4hVf67kgDI/AAAAAAAABZc/9N2H38fzrgA/s320/BusinessCardFront.jpg" width="192" /></a></div><br /><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Right now (if I remember correctly) that template is just the basic one from <a href="http://www.jakprints.com/">Jakprints</a>, though I noticed they have a slimmer business card template available that I might use instead.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The other two big bits of business I'm working on is putting together my demo reel and personal portfolio website (plug here:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.kmagameguy.com" target="_blank">Kevin's Portfolio Site</a>)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The website has been (fairly) simple to set up, despite having no previous html or css experience (please don't view the site's html source. &nbsp;It's cringe-worthy).<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Additionally, I've got a working rough cut of my demo reel put together, with the music supplied by a very good friend of mine. &nbsp;The only major issue I'm having is the encoding of the video. &nbsp;I have no idea how to stop Youtube from re-compressing it and ruining the quality. &nbsp;Even the dropbox webplayer plays it back with higher fidelity! &nbsp;When I was exporting it I used the settings suggested by Vimeo, and double checked those against what Youtube recommends. &nbsp;Both seemed pretty standard (H.264 mp4 44.1 khz audio). &nbsp;I would just upload it to Vimeo and use them to host it, but they don't have a solid mobile viewer that would work on iOS and/or Android phones/tablets; something extremely important to me when developing my site. &nbsp;I've been striving to design it in a way that is accessible on any viewing device, especially mobile ones like tablets with their growing popularity. &nbsp;For now, Youtube will have to suffice.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><object class="BLOGGER-youtube-video" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0" data-thumbnail-src="http://i.ytimg.com/vi/2zYiYngYECg/0.jpg" height="266" width="320"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/2zYiYngYECg?version=3&f=user_uploads&c=google-webdrive-0&app=youtube_gdata" />  <param name="bgcolor" value="#FFFFFF" />  <embed width="500" height="284"  src="http://www.youtube.com/v/2zYiYngYECg?version=3&f=user_uploads&c=google-webdrive-0&app=youtube_gdata" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"></embed></object></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In an effort to try and combat the quality destruction, I've put production of the actual game itself forward (against my better judgment). &nbsp;I'm going to have to change a lot of the original idea in order to fit the new production schedule, but I would very much like to have (at least) a working prototype by the end of the quarter, in time for graduation. &nbsp;This gives me an 8 week timeframe, so hopefully I can knock it out of the park. &nbsp;The hardest issue I can foresee is getting the level streaming to work properly, though as the notes on my desk that I found this morning show, I think I've pretty much worked that logic all out.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><b>UPDATE:</b></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Indeed, the crazy-hacky level streaming solution worked.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If I'm lucky, using level streaming in the UDK instead of hard map changes via console commands will preserve level changes between environments (eg a door being unlocked STAYS unlocked), since their visibility is merely being toggled on and off instead of reset with instanced map loads.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As far as details go, they're pretty scant. &nbsp;I know it'll probably be very self-referential with a lot of tongue-in-cheek directed at myself and/or the person playing the game. &nbsp;I'm being half-lazy by not including any character models. &nbsp;It'll be a challenge to make a rewarding game from a first person perspective without an NPC to interact with...</div><br /></div></div></div>
