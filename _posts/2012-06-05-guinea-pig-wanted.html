&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now that the game is finished, you might be asking yourself "what now?" &nbsp;Ok maybe you aren't. &nbsp;But I certainly am! &nbsp;Now that I've got the game ready to launch, the next step I'd like to take is getting a working MacOS build out into the wild. &nbsp;Fortunately, I don't own a Mac. &nbsp;Unfortunately, I need a Mac (or Hackintosh) to test the app bundle on, neither of which I can afford at the moment. &nbsp;If any intrepid person out there WITH a Mac rig that they're willing to turn into a test subject, I'd be very appreciative. &nbsp;Doing so would help broaden my potential audience, and would just be a generally nice thing to do considering the build options are only a couple mouse clicks different than packaging for Windows!<div><br /></div><div>So, with that said...any takers?</div><div><br /></div><div>PS! &nbsp;IndieDB responded faster than Steamworks did, so as of right now the game is live and ready to launch on June 13 via Desura! &nbsp;Check it out!</div><div><a href="http://www.indiedb.com/games/peril-on-monster-island-2-13">http://www.indiedb.com/games/peril-on-monster-island-2-13</a></div><div><br /></div><div>Now with more homepage!</div><div>http://www.kmagameguy.com/POMI.html</div>
