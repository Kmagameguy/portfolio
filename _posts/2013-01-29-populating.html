&nbsp; &nbsp;After a bit of inactivity, I spent some time crafting a few props today. &nbsp;It's always been difficult for me to kick off a project when it's in such a nebulous phase. &nbsp;I'm still not sure if I want it to be an FPS, or a sidescrolling adventure game that is staged like a play (animating lights and flipping an entire stage full of props around sounds fun as hell).<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One of the mechanics I really want to include is the ability to increase the power of your primary light source by "increasing" the oil-flow into the lit wick. &nbsp;The trouble with my initial model is that it was a candlestick and not something that could logically have a variable intensity. &nbsp;So I set out to make a whale-oil lantern. &nbsp;Hunting down the reference for this was surprisingly difficult.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VscynyalM-g/UQivWOnA-PI/AAAAAAAABkg/RgpsEje2rIo/s1600/Lantern.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VscynyalM-g/UQivWOnA-PI/AAAAAAAABkg/RgpsEje2rIo/s400/Lantern.png" width="400" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This lantern required two separate UV channels - One for the overall metal, and one for the transluscent materials like the flame and the glass. &nbsp;I realize I could have done both of these on the same UV channel with a bit of creative masking, but I wanted to use the extra UV space to get a bit of subtle grime/dust added to the glass itself, which might have been a bit difficult at a smaller scale inside the first UV channel's 1:1 space. &nbsp;I love that the metal's UV channel ended up looking like a face. &nbsp;The lantern mesh is a bit dense, but I figured it'd be a good idea to allocate a few extra polys to it since it'll be up-in-your-face through the whole experience.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After I had the secondary "weapon" finished, I started working on some general props that you might find in an early 1700s colonial farm village. &nbsp;I ended up creating a fence (with an endcap prop), a barrel, and a wooden bench. &nbsp;I wanted the fence to be a modular prop, so I paid special attention to creating it within a 128x128 square so that it'd easily tile on UDK's gridspace.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-aIeuA1Nx8pk/UQiwehuqqaI/AAAAAAAABk0/ANG0vQM6Aas/s1600/Model.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-aIeuA1Nx8pk/UQiwehuqqaI/AAAAAAAABk0/ANG0vQM6Aas/s400/Model.png" width="400" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Unlike the lantern, this model is all enveloped inside one UV channel, with a LOT of the repeated elements overlapping in the UV space. &nbsp;I think the polycount on this one turned out pretty good, I might have been able to get away with a few extra cuts for more plank detail, but since the game is going to be pretty dimly lit anyway, I figured it'd be wasted as the silhouette wouldn't have changed much. &nbsp;I was able to recycle all of the elements in the fence prop to create the endcaps, so there's no extra textures or materials on that model. &nbsp;Can't beat two for the price of one.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At this point I'm a little concerned about spending much time on developing any homes/shacks/cottages as I don't know what direction I'm taking this in yet - but I think I have enough props to start layering something together. &nbsp;I'll probably see if I can come up with some creative lighting solutions in the meantime to create visual interest in an otherwise pitch-dark environment.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;
