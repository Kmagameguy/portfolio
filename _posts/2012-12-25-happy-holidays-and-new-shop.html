I'd like to wish everyone a very Happy Holiday today! &nbsp;Here's to hoping everyone's getting some well deserved rest, relaxation, and quality time with whomever you call family!<br /><br />This year was the first time I was able to spend my full holiday time with my family post-graduation. &nbsp;I wanted to do something special this year considering I finally had some free time. &nbsp;The following was what I came up with:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-PXHcAvXRZ1k/UNpS-98nCwI/AAAAAAAABg0/U1OlZrQ2ou8/s1600/penguinposter31356179911.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-PXHcAvXRZ1k/UNpS-98nCwI/AAAAAAAABg0/U1OlZrQ2ou8/s320/penguinposter31356179911.png" width="213" /></a></div><br />The final version carried a more personal message along with it, but after a lot of revisions this was the final style I went with. &nbsp;I ended up having it printed and framed at 24"x36"(which ended up being a lot larger than I realized it would be!). &nbsp;It only took a day or so to put together after a few initial sketches, the hardest part was re-adjusting to Illustrator.<br /><br />Even though this was the only piece I actually ended up finishing and printing in time to give as a gift, I started working on a couple other projects immediately afterward.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-bMvLUkyi8lQ/UNpT0HjeGLI/AAAAAAAABhA/L9pojei9WrA/s1600/christmastreehostage1356193840.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-bMvLUkyi8lQ/UNpT0HjeGLI/AAAAAAAABhA/L9pojei9WrA/s320/christmastreehostage1356193840.png" width="213" /></a></div>This one was quicker and felt a bit more natural. &nbsp;I liked the style of the original Penguin print, so I tried to stay with the same theme.<br /><br />After some urging from family and friends I decided to set up a shop for others who might be interested in buying a print (I'm naturally pretty shy about anything I make, so this is a huuuuge step for me!). &nbsp;In my research, I stumbled upon a website by the name of Society6, which offers all kinds of awesome goodies - from framed art prints to iPhone cases/skins and throw pillows. &nbsp;You can find my brand new storefront here:<br /><br /><a href="http://society6.com/Kmagameguy">http://society6.com/Kmagameguy</a><br /><br />In the meantime, I've started working on a third piece now that I hope to have done before the new year. &nbsp;After finishing the Christmas Tree, I started playing around with other animal designs and settled on a Puppy Flutist that I thought had a fair amount of appeal (Usually I judge this based on the number and length of the squeal my girlfriend lets out upon seeing them). &nbsp;He's still a work in progress:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-yG9cfzHUwp4/UNpVZEZ5XJI/AAAAAAAABhU/l290_dtNYcM/s1600/lmoa1356324809.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-yG9cfzHUwp4/UNpVZEZ5XJI/AAAAAAAABhU/l290_dtNYcM/s320/lmoa1356324809.jpg" width="282" /></a></div><br />I have two bandmates on the books to accompany him, one bear trumpeter and a koala guitarist. &nbsp;I've always been pretty bad at settling on pleasing colors, so that step has me a little behind schedule on the Puppy. &nbsp;Once I get that sorted out I'll be adding in the other two band members. &nbsp;I plan on taking a little time to develop the background scenery as well since my first two illustrations had backgrounds that were practically non-existent.<br /><br />I'm not exactly sure where all of this is going quite yet, but it's been a fun reprieve during the holiday break to start exploring stuff again!
