&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I'll be the first to admit it, updates haven't been happening because development hasn't been happening. &nbsp;Instead of&nbsp;rationalizing&nbsp;my lack of motivation, I'm submitting to the fact that I've just been plain lazy. &nbsp;I think I finally hit a wall at about the halfway mark, especially since this portion has required the most radical change in routine. &nbsp;I've been working on a couple supplementary animations for the Penanggalan (now named Penny!). Eg: Talking, idle states, movement, etc.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Additionally, I've bitten the bullet and knuckled down on learning as much Flash as I can. &nbsp;I haven't begun to dabble with actionscript yet, instead favoring simpler solutions to complex problems. &nbsp;Instead of doing tutorials, I've been learning by trial and error - first with Penny's feed-in-telepathic-dialogue, followed by the creation of custom loading screens. &nbsp;Scaleform is pretty&nbsp;nit-picky&nbsp;in pretty much every aspect: image resolutions, image location, naming conventions, etc. &nbsp;That said, it's nice to create a UI that I know will scale properly to any window dimension (if only I could get my website to do the same thing sans-flash). &nbsp;Fortunately, I think from here on out it'll be minimal need for flash interfaces, unless I decide to try and make one for the key-entry puzzle inside the motel.<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;While not exactly enthralling, here's an example of the loading screens. &nbsp;Each environment has it's own:</div><embed height="400" pluginspage=" http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" src=" http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3050737/BeachLoading.swf " type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="530"></embed><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In a less positive light, I've realized that I have no idea where I last put my development papers. &nbsp;I move a lot so they could be anywhere from work, school, or back home (where they've certainly since been disposed of). &nbsp;Unfortunately, this means the only remnants of my gameplay plans are in the blurry teaser photos I uploaded to this blog in an earlier post. &nbsp;They're legible enough for me to remember all of the gameplay elements, but the picture was taken before I had written down feedback, feature requests, and bug reports that I had received from my playtesters. &nbsp;As an alternative, I've decided to make a google docs file that I've since distributed to my playtesters so that they can directly edit and add their own entries to the list of bugs as they encounter them. &nbsp;I actually think this is a phoenix-rising-from-the-ashes situation. &nbsp;While I am&nbsp;disappointed&nbsp;in myself for losing the lists, I think the ability for my playtesters to directly add entries will allow for faster response time (as well as being accessible from anywhere, without worry of it disappearing again).<br /><br />Cheers for now!
