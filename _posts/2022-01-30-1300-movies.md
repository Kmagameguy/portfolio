## Intro  
  
After my Nic Cage marathon wrapped in early 2021 I decided I wanted to set a watch goal for the entire year.  Originally I set the goal at 365 movies by the end of the year.  When I blew past that number in early April, I doubled it.  I hit 730 by late July/early August, so I moved the goalpost again...this time to 1200. All told by December 31st I'd watched just a hair more than 1300 films. 
  
Let me start by saying this was a grueling pace to keep up for a year.  For those playing at home, 1300 on a (non-leap year) is roughly 3.5 films a day.  I also had some rules:  
  
1. Background viewing doesn't count as a "watch".  I had to be actively engaging with the film
1. These have to be feature-length films unless there is VERY GOOD REASON to include a short film. Anything sub-60 minutes is suspect.
1. Be adventurous -- sticking to the top-awarded films of the last decade, or films I'd already seen would be boring.  
  
This made viewing during the weekdays tough, especially when work hours ran long.  On average I would watch one film in the morning before work, then two after the workday was over.  I'd go gangbusters on the weekends to make up for any lost time during the week and to build up a buffer for the following week.  In the end I found a TON of material that I loved, much of which landed squarely outside my normal comfort zone which was exciting.  I am confident I consumed more popcorn this year than any other person in history.  
  

## The List  
  
**Below is a list of the TOP 13 (or, 1%) of the total films that I watched this year.**  The criteria for this list is hard to define...I suppose the main idea is each of these films, in some way or another, have become embedded in my brain since I watched them.  That feels like the most "fair" way to create a power ranking because, as you'll see at the end, I have an "honorable mentions" list that is 200+ films longs.  
  
In short: if staying power is a strong hallmark of a "good" movie, then these were the cream of the crop:  
  
![Liyana]({{ page.image_path }}/liyana.jpg){: .img-left }
#### 13. Liyana  
<small>*Dirs. Aaron & Amanda Kopp, 2017*</small>  
  
In the simplest terms, *LIYANA* is a documentary that follows the classroom antics of orphaned children in Eswatini (formerly Swaziland).
The story blends real life interviews of the children with the fictional
story of *LIYANA* -- a girl who is sent on a dangerous quest to save her family.  The story itself is made-up by the children during the production
of the documentary, and is interwoven as an animated film.  
  
It is an awesome way to showcase the power of creativity as therapy, and while individual moments are heartbreaking, the overall narrative is one so full of childlike wonder and resilience you can't help but feel inspired.  A genuinely moving film that clocks in at a respectable seventy-seven minutes.

![Blood Diner]({{ page.image_path}}/blood_diner.jpg){: .img-left }
#### 12. Blood Diner
<small>*Dir. Jackie Kong, 1987*</small>  
  
*BLOOD DINER* was the first off-the-rails film I watched this year.  Part remake, part parody of Herschell Gordon Lewis' original *BLOOD FEAST*, Jackie Kong ratchets up the unpredictable splatterfest of the original with chaotic energy.  No, seriously, this film is the definition of chaos.  At no point did I have any idea what was going to happen next.  I suppose the easiest way to describe the premis is that it's like a more messed up *WEIRD SCIENCE:* two cannibalistic brothers ritually kill and use the parts to build a new body for an Egyptian goddess they plan to resurrect.  
  
Caveat emptor: this film is gory as they come.  But it's handled with such masterful comedic timing you'll be more worried about your sides splitting than whatever slashing is happening on screen.  I don't really understand how this film doesn't have a cult following.  It's certainly not for everyone, but if you "get it" you will have a lot of fun.
  
I also wish I had seen this on Blu-Ray.

![Searching]({{ page.image_path}}/searching.jpg){: .img-left }
#### 11. Searching
<small>*Dir. Aneesh Chaganty, 2018*</small>  
  
*SEARCHING* is one of those films whose only failing was its marketing team.  I saw the trailers for this and they bungled what is a genuinely compelling thriller by marketing it as some kind of zoomer teen-scream.  I'm glad I put my initial hesitation aside and gave this a chance.
  
*SEARCHING* is about a man, David Kim (John Cho), whose daughter is coming of age in high school.  As she and her father drift further apart, she eventually disappears.  At first it's not clear whether she simply ran away, or if something more sinister is at play.  Over the course of the film we follow David's attempts to do his own search while the local detectives conduct their investigation.  It devolves into a terrifying realization: So much of his daughter's life was lived online that the person he sees, and the person she really is, are very different.  It is both an indictment and praise of the virtual realities we all inhabit.  
  
There is a lot to love here.  Because so much of the film takes place in online spaces (facebook, skype, iMessage, etc), the movie takes a lot of its success from the painstaking detail the filmmakers put into making sure those spaces feel like the real deal.  The story itself is tense and had me guessing all the way up until the final 5-10 minutes.  I suspect this will hit harder for folks with children.  John Cho is so good in this and I cannot understand why he hasn't been given more (serious) starring roles.  
  
I would also say that circumstance probably improved my viewing of this film.  I watched this before the COVID vaccines were available so my area was largely living in isolation.  Watching this on a computer, while interacting with folks over the same sort of messengers & social medias featured in the film made for a surreal experience.  In that regard I think my home-viewing of the film was more impactful than it would have been if I'd watched it in a theater.

![The Wailing]({{ page.image_path }}/the_wailing.jpg){: .img-left }
#### 10. The Wailing
<small>*Dir. Na Hong-jin, 2016*</small>  
  
*THE WAILING* is one of those incredible films that I thoroughly enjoyed but will probably never watch again.  For one, it has a runtime of one-hundred-fifty-six minutes which is pushing the limits of my attention span.  It is also entirely in Korean & Japanese, so subtitles were necessary (this does not take away from my experience at all, but worth mentioning in case this is a hard "no" for a casual viewer).  My main contention is the same thing that makes the film so brilliant: it is terrifying and emotionally exhausting.  
  
Because the movie is so long it meanders between thematic elements quite a bit.  Ostensibly starting as a goofy buddy-cop comedy, the lighthearted gags quickly drop into a crime thriller that slowly burns its way into spiritual horror.  Without revealing too much, the short version of the premise is that a stranger arrives in a small village.  Shortly after, a mysterious sickness begins to spread among the native villagers.  A local policeman is brought on to investigate....not long before his own daughter falls into trouble.  
  
The film heavily plays on the theme of the "outsider", begging you to side with or condemn the new arrival before any reasonable amount of evidence or alibi is profferred.  This is almost too simple a description of the film suffice to say I could not correctly guess the plot until all was revealed.  I often replay the crushing denouement in my head and it's just as chilling now as it was when I first watched *THE WAILING*.  I think I would definitely rate this higher if the runtime was shortened by ~30 minutes.

![The Columnist]({{ page.image_path }}/the_columnist.jpg){: .img-left }
#### 9. The Columnist
<small>*Ivo van Aart, 2019*</small>  
  
Like *SEARCHING*, *THE COLUMNIST* also features a very "social media"-centric storyline.  Unlike *SEARCHING*, however, *THE COLUMNIST* takes a black-comedy approach to its narrative.  In this film a newspaper columnist, Femke Boot is trying to work on her first book.  She regularly receives anonymous death threats on the comment section of her newspaper column and over social media.  Eventually she runs into one of her online abusers in-person and summarily kills them.  Feeling a rush of inspiration, she begins an obsessive search to find and kill the ringleader of her online bullies.  Meanwhile hiding her newfound penchant for serial killing from her daughter and live-in boyfriend.  
  
The entire film is funny until it isn't -- that final act is shocking, to say the least.  *THE COLUMNIST* does, however, do a good job of highlighting the absurdity of anonymity and free speech online.  It's a very well done film and full credits to Katja Herbers who plays a phenomenal Femke.  The film is all in Dutch so be prepared to break out the subtitles.

![Bad Black]({{ page.image_path }}/bad_black.jpg){: .img-left }
#### 8. Bad Black
<small>*Dir. Nabwana I.G.G., 2016*</small>  
I will be honest: I had such a hard time placing *BAD BLACK* on this list.  It is the most lovable film.  I didn't rank it higher solely because I think it requires a LOT of context to understand why the film is so remarkable.  
  
*BAD BLACK* is a film that was created in the Kampala, Ugandan slum of Wakaliga.  Director Nabwana I.G.G. self-finances his films, which *at most* have a budget of $200 USD.  His actors are all residents of Wakaliga.  At best, Nabwana may have electricity three or four days a week and even then it's spotty.  He builds his computers out of whatever scrap parts he's able to salvage from the local scrapyard.  Nabwana directs, films, edits, and publishes his films all on his own and is entirely self-taught.  In fact, he had reportedly created over 30 films before his previous film, *WHO KILLED CAPTAIN ALEX* went viral.  Amazingly, he never intended for anyone outside his home town to see his films.  As a result all his prior films are lost because he has to erase his hard drive to make room for each new movie.
  
This DIY, no-budget work ethic carries over into the production of the films too.  All props are built by hand using whatever scrap they can find.  The movies are shot on location in Wakaliga, affectionately called Wakaliwood by Nabwana and the residents.  His dream is to create a real movie studio right there in Wakaliwood where he can continue to produce better and better films.  
  
So with that understanding we look at *BAD BLACK*, Nabwana's second worldwide release.  The story follows Bad Black, a resident of Kampala with a rough upbringing. Now an adult, she and her gang try to take revenge on folks who took advantage of them during their youth.  There is a lot more to it but that's the basic gist.  It is heavily influenced by American action cinema of the 80s and is a huge love letter to that entire era.  Also, the movie is hysterical.  
  
One other thing to note -- the film prominently features a voice-over "character" called VJ (video joker) Emmie.  I guess this is "a thing" in Uganda, but VJ Emmie basically talks over the movie, filling in dead air with jokes or other interjections that help explain what's happening or a character's inner thoughts.  It works way better than it should...I guess I'd liken it to a one-man Mystery Science Theater reading.  
  
Anyway, yeah, I absolutely love this film.  I've already bought a copy on Blu-Ray and ordered a ton of stuff from the Wakaliwood merch store.  Please check this out, I promise it will change your life. Supa Action.

![Suspiria]({{ page.image_path }}/suspiria.jpg){: .img-left }
#### 7. Suspiria
<small>*Dir. Dario Argento, 1977*</small>  
  
*SUSPIRIA* is a disturbing, but visually gorgeous film from the master of Giallo-style horror, Dario Argento.   All the lighting, colors, and framing are uncannily lush.  The film picks up with Suzy Bannion, a ballet-dancer from America, off to a German dance academy to further her studies.  Immediately when she arrives a series of horrors are there to greet her.  As events unfold she uncovers darker and darker secrets that eventually threaten her very life.  
  
Unless you're already familiar with Argento and his peers, *SUSPIRIA* is horror much unlike the American style you may be used to.  In a lot of ways it feels more akin to a fairy-tale, albeit one that hasn't been sanitized for children's palettes by the likes of the House of Mouse.  Tread lightly!

![The Book of Henry]({{ page.image_path }}/the_book_of_henry.jpg){: .img-left }
#### 6. The Book of Henry
<small>*Dir. Colin Trevorrow, 2017*</small>  
  
Look I'll just get this out of the way fast: *THE BOOK OF HENRY* is impossible to rate.  It is neither a good movie nor a bad one, and it is also not one you'll forget about in a hurry.  I watched this almost a whole year ago and I think about it *at least* once a week.  A wholly original, weird, inexplicable film that is better shared with friends.  
  
The premise will sound unremarkable on paper: a genius child (Jacob Tremblay) takes care of his family, coordinating finances, home-making upkeep, investments, and providing emotional support for no other reason than his mom (Naomi Watts) is a useless adult that sits around playing Gears of War all day.  He eventually stumbles into what may be a disturbing neighborly secret and it's up to his family to investigate.  That's about as good a summary I can provide without spoiling major plot points and taking away from the madness of the film.  
  
If you are fatigued by the over-saturated, big-budget, sterile, fan-service movies coming from the outsized production houses like Marvel & its ilk, you should give *THE BOOK OF HENRY* a spin.  It is the perfect panacea.

![The Night House]({{ page.image_path }}/the_night_house.jpg){: .img-left }
#### 5. The Night House
<small>*Dir. David Bruckner, 2020*</small>  
  
I knew I was going to love *THE NIGHT HOUSE* the moment I saw the big poster display at the local AMC Theater in early 2020.  The film is a mystery/thriller/horror story featuring a recently widowed Beth (Rebecca Hall).  We meet up with her character a few days after her husband's shock suicide.  The film then follows Beth aas she tries to reconcile with his passing.  As she digs into his possessions she discovers darker and darker secrets, revealing a man wholly different (and perhaps more dangerous) than the one she thought she married.  
  
Generally speaking the film is centered around mental illness and how it can poison the mind.  Much of the film's sequences can be left up to the viewer's interpretation which makes the ending satisfyingly elusive.  Rebecca Hall is fantastic as the lead (as ever) -- I cannot think of a more underrated working actor right now.  Mark Duplass maybe comes close.  
  
The visual effects are also remarkable.  We've all been spooked by visions spectres and ghosts at night, when a chair or shadow looks like something more.  *THE NIGHT HOUSE* replicates that disorientation to great effect with all sorts of camera tricks, forced perspectives, and (probably?) CGI.  It's a deeply unsettling film that I can't wait to watch again.

![Four Lions]({{ page.image_path }}/four_lions.jpg){: .img-left }
#### 4. Four Lions
<small>*Dir. Chris Morris, 2010*</small>  
  
*FOUR LIONS* takes the very serious premise of suicide bombing under the pretense of jihad and turns it into one of the most absurd, surreal, and clever british comedies I've ever watched. The plot follows a group of young men who decide to wage jihad on Sheffield, England.  What results is calamitous failure after failure thanks to the ineptitude of these morons.  Like Wile E. Coyote they leap from one bizarre idea to another to no one's detriment but their own.  It is bold, boundary-stretching political satire that might give you flashes of *DR. STRANGELOVE.*  By smartly using dialogue between these dimwit, the script sets up comedic one-two punches that are delivered with expert deadpan by this incredible cast.
  
And, speaking of the leads, this movie stars Riz Ahmed and Kayvan Novak in very early roles.  If you're fresh off Riz's *SOUND OF METAL* and/or Kayvan's *WHAT WE DO IN THE SHADOWS*, *FOUR LIONS* will give you wonderful performances from both guys. I cannot recommend this highly enough -- if you're skeptical spend five minutes looking up the trailer and then tell me you're interest isn't piqued!

![PG: Psycho Goreman]({{ page.image_path }}/psycho_goreman.jpg){: .img-left }
#### 3. PG: Psycho Goreman
<small>*Dir. Steven Kostanski, 2020*</small>  
  
<blockquote><i>
I do not caaaare for hunky booooyyyys.  ...or DO I...?
</i></blockquote>  
  
This is the movie that got me to subscribe to Shudder's streaming service.  *PSYCHO GOREMAN* is a horror comedy that's equal parts *POWER RANGERS* and *GWAR* in both substance and style.  It stars Mimi and Luke, two children who discover a magical amulet that releases "The Arch-Duke of Nighmares" from imprisonment on Earth.  The Duke is a murderous, ancient, alien overlord whose only goal is galactic destruction in the name of revenge.  By possessing the amulet, though, the kids discover they have command over the monster (whom they quickly rename Psycho Goreman, or "PG" for short).  While Mimi effectively turns PG into a plaything to torment her brother and his friends, a different alien counsel learns of PG's release and sets off for Earth hoping to stop him once-and-for-all.  
  
The movie is full of 80s camp, complete with practical creature FX and plenty of bloody schlock.  It is a maximalist exercise in taking nothing seriously.  It is completely silly, irreverent, and self-aware.  I expect this film will be pretty divisive.  Luckily, it felt tailor-made for my style of humor.  I love that in an era filled with hyper-polished superhero films, something wholly original like this can find a path to production.

![The Matrix: Resurrections]({{ page.image_path }}/the_matrix_resurrections.jpg){: .img-left }
#### 2. The Matrix: Resurrections
<small>*Dir. Lana Wachowski, 2021*</small>  
  
I have to start my review of *THE MATRIX: RESURRECTIONS* by stating I'm a *huge* fan of the four films that preceded it.  I *never* understood the critical panning *RELOADED* or *REVOLUTIONS* received, nor do I understand why *THE ANIMATRIX* didn't invade the mainstream like the first film.  In fact, *REVOLUTIONS* was one of the films that set me on my path towards wanting to make 3D "art" a career.  I remember spending *weeks* watching the final film's special features on DVD, since they included hours of behind the scenes details regarding the VFX and their breakdowns.  My only explanation for the follow-up films' critical panning is that the franchise was simply suffering from too much success.  The first film was such a landmark that it does seem like any follow-up would be doomed from the start.  
  
Which is why I am so delighted *THE MATRIX: RESURRECTIONS* exists.  Not only does it confront the oft-reductive interpretations of what made the first film work so well (bullet time! edgy fashion! gun fights! kung fu!) but it continues that first film's brash, uncompromising force-of-will to be its own thing.  *RESURRECTIONS* is a very different movie for a very different world.  This one picks up in modern time, with Keanu and Carrie-Ann reprising their roles as Neo & Trinity. This time, though, the realities of The Matrix are even more blurred and strips away all the pomp-and-circumstance of the third film's colossal setpieces and grounds us once again in a more personal story.  One of redemption, of perseverance, of being true to who (and what) you are.  It saddens me to see so many people failing to connect with this fourth story, though much like *RELOADED* and *RESURRECTIONS* I expect people will realize how good this movie is in several years' time.

![Málmhaus]({{ page.image_path }}/malmhaus.jpg){: .img-left }
#### 1. Málmhaus
<small>*Dir. Ragnar Bragason, 2013*</small>  
  
In the summer of 1983, young Hera Karlsdóttir (Thora Bjorg Helga) witnesses a freak farming equipment accident that kills her brother.  Shocked by his death, Hera recedes into herself and finds comfort in her brother's music collection.  She adopts his guitar and clothes and immerses herself in the world of Metal music.  The film then breaks for nine years, at which point we rejoin Hera as a young adult.  We see a still grief-stricken girl who lets her metal-inspired lifestyle cause mischief for everyone -- including herself.  Using the Satanic Panic and the church burnings of that era as a backdrop is effective shorthand for pitting Hera's lifestyle against judgement by her local community members.
  
Empathy is a big theme here, which feels very appropriate given the time of social-media-induced division we're all living in.  I fell in love with this movie quickly.  It is difficult to highlight what, exactly, works so well other than I also grew up a depressed metal-obsessed shut-in and relate to many of the small moments on display.  It feels very personal.  The final act is a long-build that delivers a hard-earned feel-good resolution.  The cinematography is lovely and the soundtrack kicks ASS.  Diamond Head, Savatage, Riot, Judas Priest, and more metal staples all make appearances.  I guess it's not surprising that a film produced in Iceland represents Metal culture so well but it's nice to see it.
  
I watched *METALHEAD* all the way back in July and still think about it often.  For what amounts to a farily "simple" film, its staying power is surprising.  At time of writing it's only available in SD via Kanopy's streaming service so I ended up *importing* a Region 2 copy just so I could experience it in HD.  It was a pricey purchase but I expect I'll get a lot of mileage out of it.  If your library offers a Kanopy subscription I'd seek it now!

## Streaming Services
  
One thing I failed to mention earlier is that most of this viewership took place over streaming services.  I did have to rent a small handful of the grand total for one reason or another.  Below is a list of the services I used.  I'm not affiliated in any way so the links don't kick me any cash or anything like that.  I'm listing them here purely for convenience, especially because I think a few of these aren't very well-known:

## Further Recommendations  
  
Of course, reducing a list of 1300 films down to 13 leaves no room for honorable mentions.  So, if you're looking for something else to watch I'll be keeping a running list of movies I find interesting here on the site.  You can see it here:
