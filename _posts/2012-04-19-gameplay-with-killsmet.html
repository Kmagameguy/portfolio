&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Two days in, and I think I'm about 50% done with setting up the (main) gameplay...quests...that are storyline essential. &nbsp;Creating riddles to explain the puzzles is turning out to be extremely difficult. &nbsp;I'm worried that they're either way too vague, or way too specific, and unfortunately the only way I'll know is by grabbing playtesters for some QA runs. &nbsp;For example:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-URuEx8Rtg6E/T5B_J5TpUKI/AAAAAAAABaE/B169FPeDXjc/s1600/oooOo0oOo.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="187" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-URuEx8Rtg6E/T5B_J5TpUKI/AAAAAAAABaE/B169FPeDXjc/s320/oooOo0oOo.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The other difficulty is that so many of the quests change based on events completed within other quests, that keeping everything bug-free is taking a lot more effort than I initially anticipated. &nbsp;A lot of the issue (I think) stems from the oversimplification of kismet scripting. &nbsp;It's absolutely ridiculous that in order to do something as simple as a password input system, that I'd have to learn flash AND actionscript. &nbsp;Moreover, I'd possibly need to code a custom kismet event to handle storing the input and evaluate whether it's the correct solution or not. &nbsp;I guess I shouldn't complain too much though, as using kismet to create game events is a hell of a lot easier (and faster) than writing everything from scratch in code (even if it does look like an absolute mess). &nbsp;This example is just a portion of one of the quests:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-WGC2UmHWdFY/T5CByuoA8gI/AAAAAAAABaM/4n0i6Eu4jnc/s1600/puzzling.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="244" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-WGC2UmHWdFY/T5CByuoA8gI/AAAAAAAABaM/4n0i6Eu4jnc/s320/puzzling.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Luckily, I've done enough projects in the past to know how to keep everything in the kismet window readable (even if it looks unorganized in this screenshot). &nbsp;Thank Epic for comment blocks. &nbsp;On that note, hopefully I'm not spoiling too much of the gameplay in these screenshots/updates. &nbsp;I'm already terrified that this will end up being a very short, very boring game to play through.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I'd like to have the gameplay finished, and as bug-free as possible by this weekend. &nbsp;I've still got a bit of modeling to do, largely the monster creature that is the catalyst for the entire storyline. &nbsp;I hate character modeling, and admittedly, it's been a super slow and difficult process. &nbsp;I can't even count the number of times I've started trying to model it from scratch. &nbsp;I have a feeling that'll be the biggest difficulty down the road.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In the meantime, once the gameplay is done I'll start layering in the storyline and directives to guide the player. &nbsp;I'm not sure if I should implement a help system or not. &nbsp;If I do, it'll probably just be a simple hint system bound to a hotkey that will give simple directives or reminders. &nbsp;Hopefully, this should alleviate any issues with players abandoning the game due to being stuck or lost. &nbsp;If that's not enough, I will definitely be hiding a walkthrough somewhere inside the game for players who are just absolutely hopeless, though, &nbsp;I hate using those solutions as they feel like a gross cop-out. &nbsp;Preferably, I'd like for the riddles to handle all of the directing, they'd be more immersive and organic than an omnipotent narrator. &nbsp;I'm really trying to evoke a sensation of uneasiness and loneliness.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">Anyway, cheers for now! &nbsp;Back to work! &nbsp;Fly-fly, and all that!</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-PfYJmQcdNbA/T5CGhm8zdvI/AAAAAAAABaU/oHF4f3mk778/s1600/boat.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="209" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-PfYJmQcdNbA/T5CGhm8zdvI/AAAAAAAABaU/oHF4f3mk778/s320/boat.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><br />
