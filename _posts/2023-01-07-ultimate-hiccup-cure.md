Hiccups are annoying.  If you're a regular sufferer you may have heard all the old tricks: ask someone to scare you, drink from the far side of the glass, reach for some pickle juice.  As Hobbes said:
[I think most hiccup cures were really invented for the amusement of the patient's friends][hobbes-quote].

Luckily, you can dispatch the pesky perturbations quite simply.  While I'm not a doctor, and this definitely shouldn't be construed as medical advice, I can say my method has worked for 100% of my friends, family, and colleagues.  Here's what you gotta do:

1. Take three (3) slow, deep breaths
1. Inhale deeply once more and hold your breath for 20-30 seconds
1. Exhale slowly and breathe normally

If the hiccups continue, repeat the steps above once more.  I've never seen a case that isn't cured after two tries.  I don't know why this works, but if you do get in touch!  I'd love to know the science (if there is any) behind it.
