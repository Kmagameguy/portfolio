&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As the title suggests, the game is NOW LIVE! &nbsp;Well, it's kinda been live for a while now. &nbsp;Since June 13. &nbsp;My bad. &nbsp;Check it out over at <a href="http://www.kmagameguy.com/POMI.html" target="_blank">http://www.kmagameguy.com/POMI.html</a>! (maybe donate a dollar? maybe? no? anyone? Bueller? Bueller?) &nbsp;Mostly, I just want people to play it and let me know what they think. &nbsp;Liked it? Great! &nbsp;Hated it! &nbsp;Also cool I guess! &nbsp;Most of all I'm just super excited to have actually finished a project for once, as well as finished it to a level of polish that I'm proud to stand against. &nbsp;Of course, there's tons of things I wanted to change or implement, but I think it's ok for me to call it done for now. &nbsp;Mainly because I don't have much time to do anything anymore! &nbsp;Spoiler alert ahead!<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Literally the night after graduation (magna cum laude with highest achievement award [not to toot my own horn or anything!]), I was INUNDATED (sarcasm-ish) with employment opportunities. &nbsp;One was for a teaching position near my hometown, while the other was for an Xbox project for a company in the DC area. &nbsp;With some measure of trepidation (I've always liked the idea of teaching, especially to child prodigies), I took the Xbox project gig! &nbsp;I started this past monday, so I've already served a week of time there! &nbsp;Boy howdy does time fly! &nbsp;While I'm not exactly sure what details I can and cannot discuss (NDAs being what they are and all), I CAN say with certainty that I am extremely fortunate and grateful to be where I am. &nbsp;The perks are wonderful, and my co-workers are just as excellent. &nbsp;It's nice to be a part of a seriously well-put-together team. &nbsp;The company is just a startup, so there's not much media I can float around, though if you google "Fiteeza" you might be able to find some information on your own!
