&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I should pay more attention to the content I post here.&nbsp; Unless you know me personally, you probably have no idea what I meant by "RUAAGH EVERYTHING MUST BE AWESOME SUPER DETAIL HIGH-RES REALISM BLUUGHGHGHGH" in my previous post.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Almost all of our work has changed from being game oriented to (short) film animation and photorealism. &nbsp;I&nbsp;personally haaaaate photorealism in 3D.&nbsp; While I can appreciate the technical skill required to achieve it, I don't think it's a good "style" to strive for (Mostly because it all looks the same and leaves very, very little (if any) opportunity for the artist to add their own artistic flair to a piece, but that's a whole different blog topic).&nbsp; Anyway, now that I've gotten completely away from the topic at hand here's a couple of pieces I've done for the "RUAAGH EVERYTHING MUST BE AWESOME SUPER DETAIL HIGH-RES REALISM BLUUGHGHGHGH" school of thought that should hopefully clarify what I was talking about NOT doing in my previous post:<br /><br /><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/-6l9oJUwBCOA/TpZjZzfNzaI/AAAAAAAABUQ/-cDjI7UjMS8/339362_10150321621094666_603969665_7707548_475942094_o.png" /><br /><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/-wqrJKc23Vu4/TpZjaLI5cJI/AAAAAAAABUY/K929kFzL-OM/314065_10150321620879666_603969665_7707545_110305146_n.png" /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-vomxQgwbOrI/Tt7ooA6xd9I/AAAAAAAABW0/wmQEWeEjp18/s1600/corner.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-vomxQgwbOrI/Tt7ooA6xd9I/AAAAAAAABW0/wmQEWeEjp18/s320/corner.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br />
