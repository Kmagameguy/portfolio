text-align: left;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Since I have the weekend off, I decided I'd try and make the best of it by finally putting to paper (or screen) the basic foundation for my point-and-click adventure/play game. &nbsp;Pictured above is a tentative (possibly final) version of the main character. &nbsp;The gameplay will sort of parody adventure games as well as theater plays - hopefully they go together well. &nbsp;The basic premise is that the main character (pictured above) is the maid/housekeeper to Nikola Tesla during WWI. &nbsp;While Tesla is away on business, she starts poking around his lab and accidentally fires up a machine that causes a rip in space-time in which dinosaurs start trampling through. &nbsp;Suddenly the front lines are fraught with all manner of dinos, effectively ending the war and leaving her (and the rest of humanity) sprawling to clean up the mess!</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;

text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After loading up those resources, I was really happy to see that I didn't need to tweak much (the sinfully ugly default cursor is on the top of the priorities list). &nbsp;The above kismet setup is pretty much the extent of the entire system. &nbsp;One thing I'll need to do is implement a verb system, and the ability to switch between them (eg grab/touch, speak to/with, look at). &nbsp;I'll probably stick to those three, and I'm not sure if I want to work on an inventory system or not. &nbsp;If I do, I'll probably do it in scaleform vs an unrealscript solution (or maybe even with the prebuilt Hourences kismet-based&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hourences.com/tutorials-ue3-kismet-interface/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">interface</a>). &nbsp;In terms of gameplay, I'll probably divide it up into 3-4 Acts, which will have around 2-3 chapters each (with each chapter featuring 1-2 puzzles). &nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;

&nbsp; &nbsp;The barrel was originally a stand-in for The Housekeeper, but I had such a laugh with its dialogue that I'll probably leave it in as an inside joke/easter egg with myself. &nbsp;The verbing will be pretty easy to implement, and I'll probably start working on a scaleform HUD tomorrow as well.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both;
