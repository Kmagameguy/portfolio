<div>By contrast, in rare instances I actually DO get work done. Today was one of those cases.  The following is what I like to call UV hell, (basically the unwrapping of a complex mesh).  After re-creating a character from an earlier class in a (much) lower poly density, these were the starting UVs.  I hate that 3d packages still handle UVs the same way as they always have (badly).</div><div>

They probably still look messy but for now (and with the deadline for a finished product being tuesday, and having no free-time outside of work this weekend), they'll have to do.  I can't wait until engines are able to take advantage of the pixar ptex technology.  I can unwrap stuff, it just feels like such an ancient ritual by today's standards.</div>
