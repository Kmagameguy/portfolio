It's no secret I am [wild][movie-post] for the [silver screen][movie-list] and [the collective noise we call music][music-blog].  Buying media before the streaming age was a gamble.  Maybe you'd heard a song or two on the radio, or maybe you liked the movie trailer shown between episodes of *FRIENDS.*  Beyond that you often had no idea whether your money was going towards a new favorite or a complete disappointment.  By contrast, the streaming era provides a low-risk, straightforward way to experience content that would have been cost-prohibitive, if not entirely inaccessible, in the old days before the internet.  Gone are the days of the [Disney Vault][disney-vault].

In the beginning, Netflix was King.  It was the first big breakout in the film-streaming space and as a result of its position it was able to secure content from everyone.  For the end user this was an unbelievable deal: We had access to some of the best tent-pole films of the day, alongside an endless back catalog of old favorites, for a single monthly cost that was significantly less than a competing cable subscription.  In hindsight it is obvious that wouldn't last.  The big conglomerates didn't like splitting their revenue, and as cloud technology advanced it became easier to stand up competing services.  Unsurprisingly, everyone did exactly that.  The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated things, as studios launched a multitude of services between 2019 & 2021 in an effort to recoup losses from the destruction of theater-based revenue.

As a result the Golden Age of streaming dead.  Every major studio has its own platform.  Content sharing between platforms is minimal, if they share at all.  Subscription hikes are frequent.  Ads are common again, unless you pay offensive "premium" prices.  Video quality is often poorer than the source material AND/OR restricted by "premium" tiers AND/OR restricted to "authorized" devices.  For example, some services like [Peacock simply won't work on GNU/Linux][peacock-supported-devices].  Netflix is adding account-sharing restrictions, which, if successful from a shareholder point of view, will almost certainly serve as a model for the other platforms to follow.  I can only foresee things getting worse from here.  I think it is inevitable the music space will begin to break up into microservices, relegating Spotify to the same fate as Netflix.

With so much division and so many hoops to jump through, it's hard to find the content you want without turning to crowdsourced aggregators like [JustWatch][justwatch].  Beyond the choice paralysis and anti-consumer practices mentioned earlier, there is an even darker side to streaming: You no longer own the content you consume.  Instead, you own a "license" to access that media, which gives the streaming giants the power to revoke or further paywall content whenever they want, with no responsibility to fairly compensate you for the changes.

I'll give you an example.  When Google Play Music launched in 2011 it was a great deal.  Not only could you purchase digital music directly from their store and keep it in your personal library, you could also upload your existing music to their cloud free of charge.  Your library was available wherever the Google Play Music app or website was supported (which was everywhere).  You could download local copies of your music if you wanted to.  In December of 2020 [Google did what Google does][google-graveyard] and killed the service.  Any content you hadn't transferred to YouTube Music (or downloaded) before then _was deleted forever._  To clarify - this was a manual, _opt-in_ transfer process rather than an automatic one.  Worse, YouTube Music no longer allowed you to download a local copy of your library, _even if the original content was something you uploaded rather than something sourced from the old Play store._  Instead, you were fully locked into the YouTube Music service.  Imagine all your favorite media was collected in a nice big cardboard box in your basement.  Then imagine your neighbor decided to destroy it all by flooding the basement with their garden hose.  To a non-technical uncle, grandparent, or friend, that's exactly what Google did to their hard-earned, carefully curated Play library.

The worst part is we've come to expect this digital impermanence.  Open any of the major streaming services and you'll find a "Leaving Soon!" section at the bottom of their homepage.  The comfort of knowing your [favorite show][the-office] is available to watch, any time you want, has been replaced by anxiety.  That carefully selected watchlist may soon be full of holes as content disappears or moves to another streamer.  Often, catching up with new content means adding another subscription to your already ballooning list.

Speaking of ballooning subscription services, let's talk about those costs.  Based on this article from [U.S. News][tv-cost], the average cable bill for 2022 was ~$80 USD a month.  Typically, a cable service in the U.S. offers some variety of on-demand movie streaming alongside live TV and recordable programming.  By comparison, here are the streaming services my household has access to, along with their monthly cost:

- Netflix: $15.49
- Hulu (with Ads): $7.99
- Amazon Prime Video (bundled w/Amazon Prime): $14.99 (x2) 
- Disney+: $11.99
- Paramount+ (with Ads): $5.99
- Peacock (with Ads): $4.99
- Shudder: $5.99
- HBO Max: $15.99
- ESPN+: $9.99
- Spotify (family plan): $15.99
- Gigabit Internet (Verizon): $105

Some notes:

1. This list excludes YouTube TV, since that is a "cable" service and includes some content not available on any of the other streaming services.  As an aside it also just raised our cost to an eye-watering _$72.99_ a month.
1. Only recently did we axe Apple TV+, which was adding $6.95 to our monthly total 
1. My partner and I pay for our own Prime plans, which helps avoid spoiled surprises when we order gifts for each other.  I've captured that here because you can't simply buy the "2-day shipping" portion of the membership, therefore we effectively pay for Prime Video twice.
1. Yes, I am aware of certain bundle deals which offer combined pricing for services like Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+.  It is far too much work to keep up with all the streaming "deals", not to mention they often have exclusion rules for existing members/accounts.

In total, our plans cost $125 a month for streaming services, nearly $200 if you include our internet plan, and _$300_ if you take into account our  YouTube TV (cable) subscription.  All together we're paying 3.75x _more_ than a standalone cable plan.  A $300 monthly premium is a wake-up call when statistics show that [half of Americans have less than $250 in savings][us-savings-stat].  So, what should we do about it?

# The Physical Media Reformation

I suppose the first answer could be: "Who cares"?  If you can afford it, and you don't mind the expense, then you can stop reading here.  A second, more cynical answer of course, is to recognize these expenses for what they are -- lifestyle creep -- and cancel them.  That answer, much like complaints about [smashed avocados and coffee][millenial-avo-coffee], not only misses the point but ignores the human condition entirely.  Instead, I think there's a happier middle-ground which is supported, perhaps surprisingly, by a return to [physical media][physical-media].

## Building a Backlog

To start, I'm not suggesting we buy the disc version of _every movie, show, or album_ we have a passing interest in.  Instead, I propose a slow departure from the streaming services, suplemented by a local, disc-based library of our favorite media.  To get there, we need a strategy and an awareness of the consumption options available.  A single Ultra High Definition 4K disc can easily eclipse $20 USD at retail, which is far from a cost-effective alternative even if you re-allocate your entire monthly streaming budget.  So, we need to be money-wise.  In the section below I'm working with a rough budget of $125 per month -- that's the pure cost of our streaming services minus the cable & internet costs.  Here's what's been working for me:

1. First, I figured out my video & audio quality preferences.  I LOVE watching high-quality content but if I'm honest I can't tell much difference between 4K and 1080p.  So, I usually target 4K quality for my MOST beloved media while 1080p serves as my standard option.  I'm also hedging my bets a little bit with regards to AI upscaling -- I wouldn't be surprised if we see some technologies in the coming years that can handle 1080p to 4K upscaling with great fidelity.  Your preferences of course may differ.
1. Second, I made sure to equip each TV with a media player capable of playing back 4K content.  The good news is Disc players are usually backwards compatible with Blu-Ray and standard DVD discs.
1. Third, I inventoried my streaming services.  As mentioned above there was an Apple TV subscription we were able to cut without care.  We also dropped a duplicate Hulu subscription.
1. Fourth, I worked out some of my favorite media and started collecting those.  Mainly this category was comprised of content I revisit multiple times a year, especially if it's good background noise.
1. Next, I figured out what content overlapped between services via [JustWatch][justwatch].  Obviously this is a moving target but it helped me stack rank my subscriptions from "most meaningful" to "least meaningful".
1. Then, I started collecting my favorites on disc.  My ambition is to collect favorites from one service, drop it, then repeat for the remaining services.

## Where to Get Content (for Cheap!)

If you're old like me you may remember when Hulu began life as a free streaming service packed with great content from providers like Cartoon Network.  That legacy lives on with several, perfectly acceptable, _free_ streaming services like [PlutoTV][pluto-tv] (Paramount), [TubiTV][tubi-tv] (Fox), [FreeVee][freevee] (Amazon), and [The Roku Channel][roku-channel] (Roku...naturally).  You may be surprised by what you can find on these services.

To access even more free streaming options, get a library card.  Most libraries have kept pace with digital trends and offer free benefits like eBook, Music, and Movie rentals.  Libraries often have deals with streaming services like [Kanopy][kanopy] and [Hoopla Digital][hoopla] which grant access to their digital catalogs when you sign up with a library card.  Of course, you can also visit your library in-person and rent actual discs.  Sometimes libraries will also sell excess inventory at prices less than $5 a disc.  Take advantage of your tax dollars at work.

Lastly, my favorite place to get cheap discs has to be second-hand stores and eBay.  I'm fortunate to live close to a shop which deals in tens-of-thousands of second-hand DVDs, Blu-Rays, CDs, and Vinyl. It's common to find newly released Blu-Rays for $3-5 each, and DVDs for even less.  If you don't have a similar shop nearby, you may find success through eBay and you can also keep an eye on bargain-bin sales at big retailers like Walmart.  The only downside to this approach is you'll need to have patience to find what you're looking for.

## Comparing the Cost

Given the prices noted above, is physical media cheaper?  Well, it depends.  In my case, I think it is a win.  Even at a high-cost (double the average) of $10 per movie, **my re-allocated streaming budget of $125 a month would afford me 150 Blu-Rays a year**.  That's more than enough to keep up with big blockbuster releases while setting aside some money for old favorites.  Or, to stretch the budget further, I can work with a hybrid model wherein I pay for 1 month of a streaming service at a time, once they've built up a backlog of high-value films that I want to see but not necessarily own.  I also have greater flexibility over the expenditures.  Sometimes I skip a couple months and simply pocket the difference!

As with anything, consider your own situation.  Below are some further Pros and Cons to chew over.

## Upsides

In addition to the (potential) cost savings, discs still have advantages over streaming media.  For starters, the discs almost certainly have a longer shelf-life than a streaming copy.  Discs will work without an active internet connection, and playback may already be supported by common household appliances like Gaming consoles.  Lastly, Blu-Ray discs in particular will feature better video and audio quality than any streaming service.

## Downsides

Of course, there's a convenience cost here.  Storing discs takes up space, so if your living quarters are small it can be difficult to make room.  Without proper care, Discs can get scratched or destroyed and may need replacement.  Blu-Ray players in particular may require software updates to keep up with the latest decryption keys necessary for media playback.  Sometimes these devices stop receiving updates, requiring an upgraded drive.
