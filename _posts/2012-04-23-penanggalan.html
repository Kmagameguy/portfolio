&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Well, it finally happened.  I have gotten to the point of development where it was time for me to decide if I should go ahead and create the narrative driving NPC or to find a way to write it off.  I hate characters, (both creating them, and involving them in a narrative).  Unfortunately, this whole project revolved around the original idea of creating this character, so it'd be a shame not to include it.  After a lot of time over the past couple of days I came up with this: <br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-RcYhGRkQoGw/T5YVhYGCoLI/AAAAAAAABao/tW4ReYw6nC4/s1600/rig.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-RcYhGRkQoGw/T5YVhYGCoLI/AAAAAAAABao/tW4ReYw6nC4/s320/rig.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Yes, the character is a penanggalan (good luck pronouncing that, you can read more here:&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penanggalan">Penanggalan Wiki</a>). &nbsp;The idea behind the story is that this unfortunate woman was creating a "beautification potion" to enhance her looks, but accidentally got some ingredients mixed up, causing her entire body to rip itself into pieces. &nbsp;Naturally, (since she doesn't have arms), the player has to set her straight again (eg finding the parts and learning how to bind them back into form). &nbsp;Pretty gross stuff!</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Anyway, I threw on a rough diffuse pass and created a rig for it. &nbsp;The rig itself has a lot of individual controls to allow for a lot of overlap and secondary motion in the intestinal tract (gross!), as well as controls to make the heart beat, and lungs expand and contract to imply breathing. &nbsp;(One of the best tips I've ever received about animating: &nbsp;'Making a character seem like it's breathing is the best way to make them look believable.'). &nbsp;Naturally, the standard blinking and phonemes are included as well as morph targets. &nbsp;I'm looking forward to getting this creepfest in-game. &nbsp;It'll be a very stark change of tone, despite the game's already fairly downtrodden theme. &nbsp;Oh and yeah, here's a quick run through of the rig in practice:</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><object class="BLOGGER-youtube-video" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0" data-thumbnail-src="http://i.ytimg.com/vi/xE3GY5JpNhk/0.jpg" height="266" width="320"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/xE3GY5JpNhk?version=3&f=user_uploads&c=google-webdrive-0&app=youtube_gdata" />  <param name="bgcolor" value="#FFFFFF" />  <embed width="320" height="266"  src="http://www.youtube.com/v/xE3GY5JpNhk?version=3&f=user_uploads&c=google-webdrive-0&app=youtube_gdata" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"></embed></object></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">More to come! &nbsp;Stay tuned!
