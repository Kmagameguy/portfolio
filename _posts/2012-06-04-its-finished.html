&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It's finally over (well, mostly!). &nbsp;As I write this post, a pre-gold (silver?) build of the game is being uploaded to my dropbox. &nbsp;This marks the last major commit to the project. &nbsp;From now until this Thursday (June 5, 2012), all development will be going into squashing bugs. &nbsp;In the meantime, I'll get to work on the following:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- A proper landing page linked from my website<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- A proper walkthrough for those who may or may not get stuck<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- Commentary track?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- Requesting steamworks access for distribution via Steam!<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Zb0uO_6IloM/T82gCo3oMsI/AAAAAAAABbg/VSb-zdVUwnc/s1600/mainmenu.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="187" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Zb0uO_6IloM/T82gCo3oMsI/AAAAAAAABbg/VSb-zdVUwnc/s320/mainmenu.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Main Menu</td></tr></tbody></table>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;While waiting for this thing to finally go live (Official release date of: June 13, 2012 to coincide with my graduation from college!), head on over to&nbsp;<a href="http://incompetech.com/">http://incompetech.com/</a>. &nbsp;Kevin MacLeod's royalty-free music was the sole provider for the game's soundtrack! &nbsp;Zounds!
