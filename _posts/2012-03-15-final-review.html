&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So I had my final review today. &nbsp;If I passed, I have one more semester left before graduation. &nbsp;If I failed, well, I'm out 11,000 bucks. &nbsp;Anyway, this quarter I spent most of my time touching up and finishing off the environments from a previous blog post, from the end of my last quarter. &nbsp;I'm pretty pleased with how they all turned out, considering the time constraints - plus a bonus animation of a previously built environment.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This first environment is dedicated to the spooky Witch's home. &nbsp;The environments are meant to all be a part of a singular island that is inhabited by monsters and other nefarious ne'er-do-wells, who have crafted their own homes to their liking. &nbsp;I wanted this environment to quickly and obviously evoke the idea of Halloween and a playful, dark moodiness.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both;

text-align: left;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This crypt is home to a Mummy and his (also mummified) little princess. &nbsp;Because I was hard pressed to try and tie in a naturally occurring egyptian pyramid, I decided to go with a large mausoleum facade for the entrance, located within the island's graveyard. &nbsp;Another reason that reinforced my decision to create the mausoleum was that it helped allude to the fact that there may (or probably) were previous inhabitants of this island before the monsters decided to call it home.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;
