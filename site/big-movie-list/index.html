  <h4>A List of Movies I Can Recommend to People When They Find Out I Watch a Lot of Movies and Then Inevitably Ask Me For Movie Recommendations</h4>
  <p class="text-secondary">
    I watch a lot of movies and as such, folks will often approach me for recommendations.  I'm not good at thinking on-the-spot so I've put together this list to help with that.  Below I mainly try to avoid big-name releases or otherwise really well-known films, unless I think they are remarkable for some reason.
