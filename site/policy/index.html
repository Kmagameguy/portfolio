  <h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
  <p>
    Effective date: March 14, 2021

  <p>
    Thanks for visiting my portfolio site & blog!  This website is published using Jekyll, jQuery, popper.js, lightbox.js, Bootstrap, and GitHub pages.
  </p>
  <p>
    I believe in strong user privacy protections when browsing the web.  Therefore, I have not added any trackers, ads, cookies, or analytics tools to my blog, nor do I
    share any information with third parties.
    The only information I <i>may</i> receive is content you've willingly sent to me via the e-mail links found throughout the site.
  </p>
  <p>
    While your visit is entirely anonymous to me, GitHub may
    collect minimal information (such as IP addresses, timestamps, referring pages, strictly-necessary cookies, etc) to serve the content to you.
